Party A and B each have one qubit of an entangled bell pair. A first entangles their bell pair with the q, using a cnot gate with the bell pair being the target. They then do a hadmard gate on q. After that, they measure both q and their bell pair. A then classically sends the results of both measurements to B. B will then perform 0-2 quantum gates on their bell pair to get it back to q's original state based on the measurement results. If A's bell pair measured 1, B will do an X gate on their bell pair. If q measured 1, B will do a Z gate on their bell pair. B now has q's original state in their bell pair. A bell pair that both parties have one half of is needed for this to be possible."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"hx5Gj5jh9K9g","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1615343207467,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":24494,"user":{"displayName":"Milind

that are more than 1200 km apart. Other approaches to quantum communication include ground-based ones such as sending pairs of entangled photons through fiber-obtic cables and through open air. However, these methods are limited to a few hundred km because the photons collide with atoms along the way and their state, which is very delicate, gets disrupted. Another approach involves chaining complex devices called a Quantum Repeaters, and could possibly receive, store, and resend quantum information across a long distance. However, this method is incredibly complex and is very theoretical because of its difficulty, as it involves receiving two photons from different places, storing the quantum information, and interfering them with each other prior to sending signals on a network. This must by confirming that you have stored the photons without measuring them. The current solution that he Chinese used is beaming quantum information through space and distributing them across 10s/100s of km from the ground. The satellite has numerous crystals and lasers that generate, split, and send entangled photon pairs through separate beams to the ground. The satellite produced around 6 million entangled pairs per second, but only one out of these 6 million reached the detectors on the ground because the beams weakened while travelling through the atmosphere. However, this is still a trillion times more efficient than the transmission rate of the best telecommunication fibers. \n","\n","    More recently, last december scientists from Fermilab, a labaratoiy  the US Departement of Energy office, successfully teleported photon qubits across 44 km with a success rate of above 90%. They teleported the qubits with a fiber-optic netweork and extremely high quality single-photon detectors. They are planning on contructing a Chicago-area metropolitan quantum network in the future.\n","\n","Sources: \n","- https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/china-shatters-ldquo-spooky-action-at-a-distance-rdquo-record-preps-for-quantum-internet/\n","- https://news.fnal.gov/2020/12/fermilab-and-partners-achieve-sustained-high-fidelity-quantum-teleportation/"]}]}
